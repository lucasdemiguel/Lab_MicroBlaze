This project was born because a lack of training has been detected in the graduates of the ETSIT faculty (UPM) of current curricula in the use 
of virtual processors (soft-processors) and all the associated design methodologies and capabilities, including their use together with blocks 
described in hardware description languages.

Based on the resources available in the University's electronics department, which has a large number of Nexys A7 boards, it was decided to use this platform, 
in conjunction with Xilinx development tools and its Microblaze processor. The board has numerous input and output interfaces and DDR2 memory, which provides 
a wide range of training.

The main challenge of the project was the implementation of the complete workflow, including the customization of the virtual processor, the access to different 
peripherals, the joint use of the virtual processor and the blocks described in VHDL, and the code debugging. For this purpose, various bibliographic sources 
available in the Xilinx technical documentation and various Internet sites were consulted and ordered. Once the new methodology was  stablished and tested under 
different scenarios, new tutorials were created based on the experience gained.

Therefore, the main result of this project will be a collection of tutorials, intended to be done in 1-2 hours, that will advance in hardware design using 
progressively more complex methodologies. Finally, a mid-level practice will be proposed that encompasses all the methodologies covered by the tutorials.
